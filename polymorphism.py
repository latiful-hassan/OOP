"""
Polymorphism - an object can take on many forms.

Practical applications:

    - The same methods in a class works in a similar way for different (sub)classes:
        e.g. Cat.speak()  # meow 
             Dog.speak()  # woof
             Human.speak()  # wagwan g you good yeah
             
    - The same operation works for different kinds of objects:
        e.g. sample_list = [1, 2, 3]
             sample_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
             sample_string = "people smoke for the nicotine but die from the cancer"
             
             len(sample_list)
             len(sample_tuple)
             len(sample_string)
